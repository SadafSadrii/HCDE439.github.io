<p>
                        
Project motivation:

I would like to make a sweatshirt which is a synthesizer. This garment will play different tones when it is touched on different parts. 

List of Material:

Sweatshirt: as the base of the wearable 
copper fabric: to create the pressure sensor that will sit on the sweatshirt
Pressure sensor or capacitive sensor: to create noise
Breadboard
Arduino Uno
Wires
Glue, thread, needles:  to fix the sensors and wires


Timeline:

March 2th: Gather all the materials
March 4th: make the sweatshirt and attach the conductive fabric
March 5th: attach the sensors and write the code
March 6th: test the prototype again and create the materials for submission
Plan B: if figuring out the wearable was impossible, just make a synth that sits on the table.
